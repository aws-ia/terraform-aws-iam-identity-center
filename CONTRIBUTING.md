> :exclamation: Note: Failures during funtional or static checks will prevent a pull request from being accepted.

It is a best practice to perform these checks locally prior to submitting a pull request.

## Checks Performed

- TFLint
- tfsec
- Markdown Lint
- Checkov
- Terratest

> :bangbang: The readme.md file will be created after all checks have completed successfuly, it is recommended that you install terraform-docs locally in order to preview your readme.md file prior to publication.

go install github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go test -timeout 45m
```
